# Sparsity-based curriculum learning configuration
# This configuration demonstrates progressive training from low sparsity (clean data)
# to high sparsity (real-world conditions) using synthetic data with varying
# sparsity levels [0.05, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8].
#
# The curriculum sampler filters synthetic runs by sparsity range at each phase,
# enabling the model to first learn dynamics from clean data, then progressively
# adapt to noisier, more realistic conditions.
